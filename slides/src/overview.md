## Quick Summary

What new feature does this extension provide?

- Reveal **internal structures** and **detailed property information** from the
  ISP's point of view for **end-to-end application-layer communications**
  - e.g., bottleneck links, 5G UPF, MEC, service edge

Why is this extension essential?

- Such information is **useful** in many networking scenarios
  - deriving resource correlations of flows, e.g., shared risk resource groups
    and "co-flow" scheduling[^coflow]
  - context-aware service selection and optimization, e.g., 5G UPF, MEC for
    cloud gaming, video streaming
- Such information is **fundamentally new** in ALTO
  - ALTO only has "cost" for (src, dst) pairs

## Quick Summary (2)

How does this extension provide such information?

- Internal structures: abstract network elements (ANE)
- Detailed property information: unified property map[^UP] for the ANEs
- End-to-end: (src, dst) pairs as in ALTO cost map and endpoint cost services

What are the potential technical problems and how to address them?

- Representation issue: how to represent the internal structures?
  - ~~physical~~ v.s. abstract
  - persistent v.s. temporary
  - Decision: **abstract network element both persistent and temporary**
- Practical considerations
  - Scalability & consistency: one-round communication v.s. two-round communication
  - Complexity: design a new message format v.s. reuse ALTO message format
  - Decision: **one-round communication with a multipart response**

<!-- ANE must be mutually exclusive to ensure correctness -->

## Recap of -08

**Finalize the specification for cost type**

- cost mode: array, cost metric: ane-path

**Clarify the property negotiation process**

- Available properties are announced in an IRD entry capability
- Selected properties are submitted in a query

**Introduce persistent-entities property as an initial registry entry**

- An array of entity identifiers that are persistent in the scope of an ALTO server

**Clarify Part Resource ID (integration with SSE)**

- Sync'd with SSE draft -16 (draft-ietf-alto-incr-update-sse-16)
- ResourceID of each part = Client ID + '.' + Part Resource ID

**Propose solutions for cost calendar compatibility**

- Flows only interfere in the same time interval

  $\Rightarrow$ The calendar results can be inferred from the PV of each
  interval

- Both correlations and properties may change over time

  $\Rightarrow$ Only make the PV part calendared (enough to represent both changes)

## Updates

In -09 (a minor revision)

- We emphasize that ANE by design is dynamic to the query in multiple places in
    the document (in introduction, terminology, specification, etc.)
- We also highlight the benefits of on-demand dynamic ANEs
  - It reduces the information leaked to multiple queries
  - The ALTO server can use property-specific optimizations to compute ANEs

## Remaining issues

**Dependency on the UP draft**

- Terminology from the UP draft (e.g., Entity, Entity Domain, etc., Sec 3)

- The property map part reuses the response data format from UP (in Sec 7.1.6
  and 7.2.6)

- One property domain and two properties are registered using the UP
  registration procedure (which may lead to an IANA dependency, Sec 12)

- Sync'd with UP -08

**Dependency on the SSE draft**

- Sync'd with SSE -16
- SSE -17 includes multipart handling so the related part can now be removed
  from PV (to be done in the next submission)
- Terminology inconsistency (**part resource Id** in PV and **content Id** in SSE)

## Revision Plan

**Writing**

- Fix the dependency issues
- Improve the quality of writing
  - Need feedback from the WG

## Revision Plan (2)

**Heterogeneous ANE?**

- Why
  - The Internet infrastructure has heterogeneous components already
  - Side meeting talks (e.g., cloud gaming) and some other IETF work (e.g., CFN)
    show that capability discovery is useful in network-aware end-to-end
    communication
  - ALTO PV can be used as a mechanism to expose capabilities for end-to-end
    communication
  - This strengthens the power of ALTO extensions and extends the scope of ALTO
- How
  - Define the entity type hierarchy for ANEs
  - The capabilities announced in IRD reuses the UP capabilities
- What follows
  - Identify ANE types (maybe work with other WG) and register the entity type,
    properties and their bindings to UP

## Conclusion

- Current status
  - The motivations and potential problems are relatively clear
  - Most part of the specifications are relatively complete and stable
  - New inputs are received during IETF 106
- Great thanks to the coauthors and the WG for the feedback and guidance
- Next steps:
  - Make a revision
  - Set a milestone for WGLC? (Maybe IETF 107)
  - Call for reviews
