This document defines an ALTO extension that allows a resource to provide not
only scalar cost values but also aggregations of network components and their
properties on the paths between different PIDs or endpoints. The extended
information can be used to improve the robustness and performance for high-speed
data transfers, such as virtual overlay networks and CoFlow scheduling. This
document introduces abstract network element (ANE) as an abstraction for
aggregated network components. It extends the base protocol and the Unified
Property extension to enable the capability of encoding such information in a
"path vector", i.e., an array of ANEs that are traversed by traffic from a
source to a destination.
