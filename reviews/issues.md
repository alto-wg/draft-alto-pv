This is a friendly update from the authors of the path vector draft. To be up
front, we are wrapping up nicely on defining the new cost type (cost-mode:
array, cost-metric: ane) and the  new domain. These, however, are only two of
the three building blocks. The third building block, on integrating the cost
map and the property map, however, still needs final touch. During the design,
the LHC/esnet use case and the software defined coalition use case provide
strong support for the benefit of the path vector capability. On the other
hand, they result in more diversity in the supported scenarios.

In a nut shell, the key issues are two:

1. How to handle compound data: cost map, endpoint cost map, and property map
   are all already defined. What PV needs is an integration. There are two
   approaches: (1) absorption reuse, in that we define a specific new type and
   import the existing types to build a new, single top-level object; (2)
   independent reuse, in that we allow the existing objects to remain
   independent and hence the system now consists of multiple top-level objects.
   The current design, using multipart, is (2), but some authors have a strong
   preference on (1).
2. How to (Do we) handle “anonymous” resources? In several use cases, the
   property map is specific to the cost map. Hence, it should not be considered
   as an independent resource. Just as Java and some other languages support
   anonymous functions (e.g., some event handler), we can benefit from such
   a support. The authors are discussing the final wording.

I also want to add a side note on the PV draft. I see that in Section 10.1 the
privacy concern of PV is discussed and the network is suggested to provide
protection mechanisms when application and network are not in the same trust
domain. I wonder if the draft should be more specific on what mechanisms can be
used and the corresponding trade-offs? One strawman is to let the network
return a slightly smaller capacity region in the cost and property map. 

I'm not sure how important such privacy concerns can be for wrapping up the
draft, or the simple discussion in the current write-up is already sufficient,
just trying to throw in my two-cent. :-)

Hi Richard and WG,

On Issue 1:

My personal opinions on Issue 1 are:

1. Both work in a single query and Approach 2 may look simpler.
2. However, Approach 1 eliminates the need to "name" the property map. Thus, it
   may work with the current SSE extension much more easily: Issue 2 will not
   even be raised.

On Issue 2:

The anonymous functions (at least in JVM-based languages) are not really
"anonymous" -- the compilers name the functions internally. Applying the
similar method in ALTO, anonymous resources should be those temporarily
generated by a query and should be automatically named by the ALTO server.

There are three approaches. 

1. Use "resource-id" in "vtag". The easiest way seems to force a "vtag" field
   be included in ALL responses and the ALTO Server fills in the "resource-id"
   field for each "anonymous resource". However, it does not work with Filtered
   Network Map. 
2. Use the combination of "resource-id" and "tag". Might be tricky when using
   SSE, such as for a combination of Network Map and its corresponding Filtered
   Network Map together.
3. Add a new field. Seems like the most clean way. 

Summary:

One concern is that the benefits of anonymous resources are not that obvious at
the moment. If we ever choose to introduce anonymous resources, my preference
would be 3, 1, 2. And only in that case should we prefer Approach 2 in Issue 1.

Hi all, after a review of path vector (current version in github), I find the
following things to be done:

1. In introduction, [I-D.yang-alto-topology] proposes a network topology called
   “node-link schema”. It does not provide other candidate network view
   abstractions, so it does not provide path vector abstraction. The
   description of this part needs to be removed. 
2. We use the terminology “path-vector” for the extension and the cost type;
   “path vector” for the network view abstraction and cost values. It causes
   confusion. We should use other terms if possible.
3. The response of the service can be solved by multipart, so it can be
   extended to a general response format. Can the request format also be
   extended to a general format like multipart?
