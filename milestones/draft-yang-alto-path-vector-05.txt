                 ALTO Extension: Path Vector Cost Mode
                   draft-yang-alto-path-vector-05.txt

Abstract

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has defined
   network and cost maps to provide basic network information, where the
   cost maps allow only scalar (numerical or ordinal) cost mode values.
   This document introduces a new cost mode called path-vector to allow
   ALTO clients to support use cases such as capacity regions for
   applications.  This document starts with a non-normative example
   called multi-flow scheduling (or capacity region) to illustrate that
   ALTO cost maps without path vectors cannot provide sufficient
   information.  This document then defines path-vector as a new cost
   mode.

1.  Introduction

   The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] is designed for exposing network
   information through services such as the Network Map service and the
   Cost Map service.  These services use the extreme "single-node"
   abstraction, which represents the whole network with a single node
   and hosts are connected to the node's access ports.

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector            March 2017


   Although the "single-node" abstraction works well for many settings,
   new use cases, such as inter-datacenter data transfers and scientific
   high-performance computing data transfers, require additional network
   information beyond the single-node abstraction, to support
   application capabilities, in particular, the ability of application
   flow scheduling.

   Specifically, providing network information to support application
   flow scheduling introduces multiple complexities.  First, the
   underlying assumption of existing ALTO services is single-commodity
   flows.  Hence, given the flow from a source to a destination, ALTO
   computes the network metrics of the flow and returns them to the
   application.  The metric values for different flows are independent.
   Application flow scheduling, however, requires network information to
   compute application-desirable multi-commodity flows, where multiple
   flows under the control of the same application may share common
   network bottlenecks.  This requirement is beyond the capability of
   the single-node abstraction adopted by the base ALTO protocol.
   Second, some flow scheduling problems may consider end-to-end metrics
   at the same time and thus require multiple costs to be updated
   simultaneously.  Such a requirement, even though already addressed by
   [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost], still needs to be handled very carefully.

   To address these complexities in supporting the new flow scheduling
   use case, this document specifies a path-vector extension to the base
   ALTO protocol.  This extension introduces a new cost type, which uses
   "path-vector" as cost mode and "ane" (abstract network element) as
   cost metric.  It also extends "Filtered Property Map" defined in
   [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props] to address the issue of scalability
   and consistency in providing path vectors with fine-grained
   information.  This document also registers a new entity domain,
   entity specification and properties in the ALTO Entity Domain
   Registry.  Besides, (Filtered) Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Service are
   extended to support path-vector.

   The document is organized as follows.  Section 3 gives an example of
   flow scheduling to illustrate the need to introduce cost mode "path-
   vector" and cost metric "ane".  Section 4 gives an overview of the
   path-vector extension.  Section 6 specifies the new cost mode and
   cost metric, new domain type, entity properties and protocol
   extensions for (Filtered) Cost Maps and Endpoint Cost Services.
   Section 7 presents several examples.  Section 8 discusses the
   compatibility issues with some other proposed ALTO extensions.
   Section 9 discusses several design decisions.  Section 10 and
   Section 11 discusses about security and IANA Considerations.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms: Network Element, Network
   Element Name, Network Element Property, Network Element Property Map
   and Path Vector.

   o  Network Element (NE): A Network Element is an abstract network
      element, which can be a link, a network switching device, or a set
      of devices.

   o  Network Element Name (NEN): The id of a NE.  It can be referenced
      by Cost Map, Filtered Cost Map, Endpoint Cost Service and Property
      Map.

   o  Network Element Property (NEP): The property of a NE.  It can be
      the available bandwidth of a link, the delay or other available
      properties.

   o  Network Element Property Map (NEP Map): It is a Property Map
      resource defined in [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props] and contains
      "ane" in its "domain-types" capability.

   o  Cost Map, Filtered Cost Map, Endpoint Cost Service: If not
      explained explicitly, they are as the same definition of
      [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost] by default.

   o  Path Vector (PV): An array of NENs.  It can be used to convey the
      routing information.

3.  Use Case: Capacity Region for Multi-Flow Scheduling

   Consider the case that routing is given.  Then what application-layer
   traffic optimization will focus on is traffic scheduling among
   application-layer paths.  Specifically, assume that an application
   has control over a set of flows F = {f_1, f_2, ..., f_|F|}. If
   routing is given, what the application can control is x_1, x_2, ...,
   x_|F|, where x_i is the amount of traffic for flow i.  Let x = [x_1,
   ..., x_|F|] be the vector of the flow traffic amounts.  Due to shared
   links, feasible values of x where link capacities are not exceeded
   can be a complex polytype.

   Specifically, consider a network as shown in Figure 1.  The network
   has 7 switches (sw1 to sw7) forming a dumb-bell topology.  Switches
   sw1/sw3 provide access on one side, sw2/sw4 provide access on the
   other side, and sw5-sw7 form the backbone.  End hosts eh1 to eh4 are
   connected to access switches sw1 to sw4 respectively.  Assume that
   the bandwidth of each link is 100 Mbps.

             Figure 2: Base Single-Node Topology Abstraction.

   Consider an application overlay (e.g., a large data analysis system)
   which needs to schedule the traffic among a set of end host source-
   destination pairs, say eh1 -> eh2, and eh3 -> eh4.  The application
   can request a cost map providing end-to-end available bandwidth,
   using 'availbw' as cost-metric and 'numerical' as cost-mode.

   Assume that the application receives from the ALTO server that the
   bandwidth of eh1 -> eh2 and eh3 ->eh4 are both 100 Mbps.  It cannot
   determine that if it schedules the two flows together, whether it
   will obtain a total of 100 Mbps or 200 Mbps.  This depends on whether
   the routing paths of the two flows share a bottleneck in the
   underlying topology:

   o  Case 1: If eh1 -> eh2 and eh3 -> eh4 use different paths, for
      example, when the first uses sw1 -> sw5 -> sw7 -> sw2, and the

      second uses sw3 -> sw5 -> sw6 -> sw7 -> sw4.  Then the application
      will obtain 200 Mbps.

   o  Case 2: If eh1 -> eh2 and eh3 -> eh4 share a bottleneck, for
      example, when both use the direct link sw5 -> sw7, then the
      application will obtain only 100 Mbps.

   To allow applications to distinguish the two aforementioned cases,
   the network needs to provide more details.  In particular, it needs
   to provide the following new capabilities:

   o  The network needs to expose more detailed routing information to
      show the shared bottlenecks.

   o  The network needs to provide the necessary abstraction to hide the
      real topology information as possible.

   The path-vector extension defined in this document will satisfy all
   the requirements.

   See [I-D.bernstein-alto-topo] for a survey of use-cases where
   extended network topology information is needed.

4.  Overview of Approach

   This section presents a non-normative overview of the path-vector
   extension defined in this document.  It assumes the readers are
   familiar with (Filtered) Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Service defined
   in [RFC7285], their extensions defined in [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost]
   and Filtered Property Map defined in [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props].

4.1.  Path Vector Data Format

   The path-vector extension defined in this document introduces "path-
   vector" as a cost mode, where a path vector between two entities
   (either PIDs or endpoints) is an array of abstract network elements.
   Each abstract network element is represented by a name.  An abstract
   network element can be a link, a network switching device, or a set
   of devices.

   One issue of introducing path vectors is how to encode them.  The
   cost entries contained in an ALTO (Filtered) Cost Map or Endpoint
   Cost Map are formally defined in Section 11.2.3.6 [RFC7285] to be any
   type of JSON value.  But the section also suggests that
   implementations may assume the cost values are numbers unless
   specifically defined by an extension.  This document extends the
   definition of Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Map to allow the returned

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector            March 2017


   cost to be a path vector, which is a JSONArray of Network Element
   Names.

4.2.  Filtered Network Element Property Map

   The response with only the names of network elements does not provide
   enough information.  To be useful to applications, the extension need
   to provide desired properties of the abstract network elements as
   well.  This document registers a new entity domain "ane" and entity
   specifications.  The Filtered Property Map defined in
   [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props] supporting "ane" domain (named
   Filtered Network Element Property Map) is used for ALTO clients to
   retrieve the properties of abstract network elements.

4.3.  Immediate Resources and Dependencies

   The path-vector extension requires the (Filtered) Cost Map resource
   or Endpoint Cost Service resource to provide the extra information
   for the dependent Filtered Network Element Property Map resource.
   Although "uses" attribute is defined in Section 9.1.5 of [RFC7285] to
   convey the information of dependent resources, it can only be used to
   indicate the dependency of the existing resources with the exact
   resource IDs.  In the path-vector extension, the Filtered Network
   Element Property Map resource may not exist until the associated
   resource is queried.

   This document introduces a new information resource attribute,
   "immediate-uses", to declare some dependent dynamic resources.  This
   attribute does not reference the dependent resources by resource IDs,
   but use some descriptors to reference the immediate resources.

5.  Changes Since Version -03

   o  Define "ne" and "ane" as the only cost metrics of the cost mode
      "path-vector".

   o  Define new entity domains for network property map and add the
      "availbw", "delay" property to these domains.

   o  Use Filtered Property service to query properties of network
      elements.

   o  Augment the request schema of the (Filtered) Cost Map and Endpoint
      Cost Service.

6.  Protocol Extensions

   This section formally specifies the path-vector extension which
   includes the following components: a new cost type, a new entity
   domain, extensions of (Filtered) Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Map.
   Below we specify each component in details.

6.1.  Cost Type

   The path-vector extension defined in this document enriches the cost
   types defined in Section 6.1 of [RFC7285].

6.1.1.  Cost Metric

   This document specifies a new cost metric: "ane".  It is of type
   CostMetric as defined in Section 10.6 of [RFC7285].  The cost metric
   "ane" MUST NOT be used when the cost mode is not "path-vector" unless
   it is explicitly specified in a future extension.  Meanwhile, an ALTO
   server with path-vector extension MUST support the cost metric "ane".

   Cost metric "ane":  This cost metric MUST be encoded as the
      JSONString "ane".  When cost metric is "ane", Network Element
      Names contained in the path vectors MUST be query-specific.  In
      this case, different path-vector queries to the same (Filtered)
      Cost Map or Endpoint Cost Service MAY have different Filtered
      Network Element Property Maps.

6.1.2.  Cost Mode: Path Vector

   This document specifies a new cost mode: "path-vector".  The path-
   vector cost mode is of type CostMode as defined in Section 6.1.2 of
   [RFC7285] and is encoded as the JSONString "path-vector".

   A (Filtered) Cost Map resource or Endpoint Cost Service, when queried
   with this cost mode, MUST return a CostMapData or EndpointCostMapData
   whose cost value is a JSONArray of type NetworkElementName as
   specified in Section 6.1.3.

   This cost mode MUST be used with the cost metric "ane" unless it is
   explicitly specified by a future extension.

6.1.3.  Network Element Name

   This document also extends [RFC7285] with a new basic data type:
   NetworkElementName.  A NetworkElementName is of type EntityAddr as
   defined in Section 2.3 of [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props] and is
   encoded as a JSONString.  A NetworkElementName MUST be an EntityAddr
   of the ANE domain (Section 6.2).

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector            March 2017


6.2.  ANE Domain

   This document specifies a new domain in addition to the ones in
   [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props].

6.2.1.  Domain Name

   ane

6.2.2.  Domain-Specific Entity Addresses

   Entity address of ANE domain MUST be encoded as a JSONString with the
   same format as PID name defined in Section 10.1 of [RFC7285].

6.3.  Filtered Network Element Property Map

   A Filtered Network Element Property Map MUST be a Filtered Property
   Map as defined in Section 5 of [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props].

6.3.1.  Accept Input Parameters

   The input parameters of a Filtered Network Element Property Map MUST
   conform to the format in Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props].  The EntityAddr in the request MUST
   have the same format as Network Element Name specified in
   Section 6.1.3.

6.3.2.  Capabilities

   A Filtered Network Element Property Map MUST have capabilities
   "domain-types" and "prop-types" as defined in Section 4.4 of
   [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props].  The "domain-types" capability MUST
   contain ane".  And the "prop-types" capability MUST be a subset of
   property types which are registered with the "ALTO Network Element
   Property Type Registry" defined in Section 11.4 of this document.

6.3.3.  Response

   The "vtag" field MUST be included in the "meta" field of a response
   to a Filtered Network Element Property Map, with the same format as
   defined in Section 11.2.1.6 of [RFC7285].

   The response is the same as for the Property Map, as defined in
   Section 4.6 of [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props], except that only the
   requested entities and properties are returned for Filtered Network
   Element Map. Examples can be found in Section 7.4.

6.4.  IRD Extensions

   This document extends Information Resource Directory (IRD) defined in
   Section 9.2 of [RFC7285] by introducing a new information resource
   attribute.

6.4.1.  Immediate Resource Entry

   Considering that some resources are dynamically generated and only
   kept in the server for a short piece of time, it requires a new data
   type to provide such information resources.  This document calls such
   information resoruces Immediate Resources, and introduces a new
   information resource entry called ImmediateResourceEntry to present
   their attributes.  Since Immediate Resources are not static, they
   have no exact "uri" attributes.  The encoding of
   ImmediateResourceEntry is defined as the following:

     object {
       JSONString      media-type;
       [JSONString     accepts;]
       [Capabilities   capabilities;]
       [ResourceID     uses<0..*>;]
     } ImmediateResourceEntry;

   media-type, accepts, capabilities, uses:  As defined in Section 9.2.2
      of [RFC7285].

6.4.2.  Immediate Dependent Resources

   In this document, the information provided in an information resource
   may use information provided in some other Immediate Resources.  The
   "immediate-uses" attribute conveys such information.

6.4.3.  Encoding

   The IRDResourceEntry object defined in Section 9.2.2 of [RFC7285] is
   extended as follows:

     object {
       JSONString               uri;
       JSONString               media-type;
       [JSONString              accepts;]
       [Capabilities            capabilities;]
       [ResourceID              uses<0..*>;]
       [ImmediateResourceEntry  immediate-uses<0..*>;]
     } IRDResourceEntry;

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector            March 2017


   immediate-uses:  A list of ImmediateResourceEntry objects that
      provide the attributes of the immediate resources on which this
      resource directly depends.  The dependent immediate resources MUST
      exactly include the same attributes as the corresponding
      ImmediateResourceEntry objects do.

6.4.4.  ImmediateVersionTag

   A immediate version tag is similar to the VersionTag defined in
   Section 10.3 of [RFC7285] but add a new attribute "time-out".  The
   ImmediateVersionTag object is defined as the follow:

     object {
       ResourceID resource-id;
       JSONString tag;
       [JSONNumber time-out;]
     } ImmediateVersionTag;

   resource-id:  Provide the resource ID of the generated immediate
      resource.

   tag:  Indicate the tag attribute of the generated immediate resource.

   time-out:  If present, the immediate resource will only be kept in
      the ALTO server for time-out seconds.  After that, this resource
      will be deleted.

6.5.  Cost Map Extensions

   This document extends Cost Map defined in Section 11.2.3 of [RFC7285]
   by providing new capabilities, returning JSONArray instead of
   JSONNumber as the cost value, and adding a new field referencing to
   the dependent Filtered Network Element Property Map.

   The media type (Section 11.2.3.1), HTTP method (Section 11.2.3.2),
   accept input parameters (Section 11.2.3.3) and "uses"
   (Section 11.2.3.5) specifications are unchanged.

6.5.1.  Capabilities

   The CostMapCapabilities object defined in Section 11.2.3.4 of
   [RFC7285] is extended as follows:

     object {
       JSONString cost-type-names<1..1>;
       [JSONString network-element-prop-types<1..*>;]
     } CostMapCapabilities;

   cost-type-names:  The same as defined in Section 11.2.3.4 of
      [RFC7285].

   network-element-prop-types:  This field MUST be specified when the
      "cost-type-names" field is cost type path-vector and MUST NOT be
      specified if not.  This field indicates the properties of network
      elements that this resource is able to provide.

6.5.2.  Response

   The response is the same as defined in Section 11.2.3.6 of [RFC7285]
   except the follows:

   o  If the cost mode is "path-vector", the cost is a JSONArray of
      Network Element Names.

   o  If the cost mode is "path-vector", the "meta" filed MUST include
      the "immediate-dependent-vtags" field, whose value is a single-
      element array of the type ImmediateVersionTag defined in
      Section 6.4.4 to indicate the immediate version tag of the
      Filtered Network Element Property Map used, where the attributes
      of the Filtered Network Element Property Map are specified in
      "immediate-uses" of the IRD.

6.6.  Filtered Cost Map Extensions

   This document extends the Filtered Cost Map defined in Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost], by providing new capabilities, returning
   JSONArray instead of JSONNumber as the cost value, and augmenting the
   usage of input parameters.

   The media type, HTTP method and "uses" specifications are unchanged.

6.6.1.  Capabilities

   The FilteredCostMapCapabilities object is the same as defined in
   Section 4.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost] expect the follow:

   testable-cost-type-names:  Cost type "path-vector" MUST NOT appear in
      the "testable-cost-type-names" field.

   <!-- network-element-prop-types:  This field MUST be specified when
      the "cost-type-names" field includes cost type path-vector and
      MUST NOT be specified if not.  This field indicates the properties
      of network elements that this resource is able to provide. -->

6.6.2.  Accept Input Parameters

   The ReqFilteredCostMap object remains the same as defined in
   Section 4.1.2 of [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost].  But the meanings and
   the constraints of some fields are extended as follows:

   cost-type:  If the cost type is path-vector and neither the
      "testable-cost-type-names" field is provided by the server nor the
      "testable-cost-types" field is provided by the client, the
      "constraints" field and the "or-constraints" field SHOULD NOT
      appear.

   multi-cost-types:  If "multi-cost-types" includes cost type path-
      vector, meanwhile, neither the "testable-cost-type-names" field is
      provided by the server nor the "testable-cost-types" field is
      provided by the client, the cost type index of path-vector MUST
      NOT appear in the "constraints" field or the "or-constraints"
      field.  If not, the ALTO server MUST return an error with error
      code E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE.  The server MAY include an optional
      field named "field" in the "meta" field of the response, the value
      of "field" is "constraints" or "or-constraints".  The server MAY
      also include an optional field named "value" in the "meta" field,
      the value of "value" is "path-vector".  If the "value" field is
      specified, the "field" field MUST be specified.

   testable-cost-types:  "testable-cost-types" SHOULD NOT include path-
      vector cost type.  If "testable-cost-types" contains path-vector
      cost type, the ALTO server MUST return an error with error code
      E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE.  The server MAY include an optional field
      named "field" in the "meta" field of the response, the value of
      "filed" is "testable-cost-types/cost-mode".  The server MAY also
      include an optional field named "value" in the "meta" field, the
      value of "value" is "path-vector".  If the "value" field is
      specified, the "field" field MUST be specified.

6.6.3.  Response

   The response is the same as defined in Section 4.1.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost] except the follows:

   o  Whether the "cost-type" field or the "multi-cost-types" field
      includes cost type path-vector, the cost is a JSONArray of Network
      Element Names.

   o  If the cost mode is "path-vector", the "meta" filed MUST include
      the "immediate-dependent-vtags" field, whose value is a single-
      element array of the type ImmediateVersionTag defined in

      of the Filtered Network Element Property Map are specified in
      "immediate-uses" of the IRD.

6.7.  Endpoint Cost Service Extensions

   This document extends the Endpoint Cost Service defined in
   Section 4.2 in [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost], by providing new
   capabilities, returning JSONArray instead of JSONNumber as the cost
   value, and augmenting the usage of input parameters.

   The media type, HTTP method and "uses" specifications are unchanged.

6.7.1.  Capabilities

   The same as defined in Section 6.6.1.

6.7.2.  Accept Input Parameters

   The ReqEndpointCostMap object remains the same as defined in
   Section 4.2.2 of [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost].  But the meanings and
   the constraints of some fields are extended as follows:

   cost-type:  If the cost type is path-vector and neither the
      "testable-cost-type-names" field is provided by the server nor the
      "testable-cost-types" field is provided by the client, the
      "constraints" field and the "or-constraints" field SHOULD NOT
      appear.

   multi-cost-types:  If "multi-cost-types" includes cost type path-
      vector, meanwhile, neither the "testable-cost-type-names" field is
      provided by the server nor the "testable-cost-types" field is
      provided by the client, the cost type index of path-vector MUST
      NOT appear in the "constraints" field or the "or-constraints"
      field.  If not, the ALTO server MUST return an error with error
      code E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE.  The server MAY include an optional
      field named "field" in the "meta" field of the response, the value
      of "field" is "constraints" or "or-constraints".  The server MAY
      also include an optional field named "value" in the "meta" field,
      the value of "value" is "path-vector".  If the "value" field is
      specified, the "field" field MUST be specified.

   testable-cost-types:  "testable-cost-types" SHOULD NOT include path-
      vector cost type.  If "testable-cost-types" contains path-vector
      cost type, the ALTO server MUST return an error with error code
      E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE.  The server MAY include an optional field
      named "field" in the "meta" field of the response, the value of
      "filed" is "testable-cost-types/cost-mode".  The server MAY also

      include an optional field named "value" in the "meta" field, the
      value of "value" is "path-vector".  If the "value" field is
      specified, the "field" field MUST be specified.

6.7.3.  Response

   The response is the same as defined in Section 4.2.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-alto-multi-cost] except the follows:

   o  Whether the "cost-type" field or the "multi-cost-types" field
      includes cost type path-vector, the cost is a JSONArray of Network
      Element Names.

   o  If the cost mode is "path-vector", the "meta" filed MUST include
      the "immediate-dependent-vtags" field, whose value is a single-
      element array of the type ImmediateVersionTag defined in
      Section 6.4.4 to indicate the immediate version tag of the
      Filtered Network Element Property Map used, where the attributes
      of the Filtered Network Element Property Map are specified in
      "immediate-uses" of the IRD.

7.  Examples

   This section explains a series of examples to proceed the multi-flow
   scheduling like the use case in Section 3.

   The recommended workflow is like the following:

   o  Send the GET request for the whole Information Resource Directory.

   o  Look for the resource of the Filtered Cost Map which contains the
      "path-vector" cost mode and the expected "network-element-prop-
      types" in the capabilities.

   o  Send the GET request for dependent Network Map.

   o  Send the POST request for the Filtered Cost Map.

   o  After getting the response with the immediate version tag of the
      dependent Filtered Property Map, send the GET request for the IRD
      entry of the Filtered Property Map to get its URI.  And then send
      the POST request for the Filtered Property Map.

   o  If necessary, subscribe the Filtered Cost Map, the dependent
      Network Map and the Filtered Property Map into the incremental
      update resource.

   path-vector extension.  Both "availbw" and "delay" are available in
   the associated Filtered Network Element Property Map of "filtered-

7.3.  Endpoint Cost Map Example

   If the ALTO client expects the routing state information between
   endpoints, it can also query the "default-endpoint-cost-map" resource
   which supports Path Vector.

8.  Compatibility

8.1.  Compatibility with Legacy ALTO Clients/Servers

   Legacy ALTO clients SHOULD NOT send queries with path vector
   extension and ALTO servers with this extension SHOULD NOT have any
   compatibility issue.  Legacy ALTO servers do not support cost types
   with the "path-vector" cost mode and MUST NOT announce the extended
   cost types in IRD.  Thus, ALTO clients MUST NOT send queries
   specified in this extension to legacy ALTO servers according to
   Section 11.3.2.3 [RFC7285].

8.2.  Compatibility with Multi-Cost Extensions

   Path Vector extension SHOULD be fully compatible with Multi-Cost
   extensions.

8.3.  Compatibility with Incremental Update

   There is no compatibility issue with incremental update extension.

9.  Design Decisions and Discussions

9.1.  Path Vector or Path Graph

   When we introduce the "path-vector" as a cost mode in the Cost Map,
   an unavoidable problem is how to handle multipath.  Because a PID is
   a group of endpoints, it is common that there are multiple paths
   between two PIDs.  The valid routing state information is all of the
   accessible paths.  So in this scenario, the Cost Map Resource SHOULD
   provide the cost values including of the multiple paths.

   A natural solution is to provide an array of path vectors as the cost
   value.  Every path vector in this array means an accessible path
   between the source PID and the destination PID.  It is different from
   the solution of the path vector extension which provides an array of
   network elements.  So it requires to introduce a different cost mode.
   This document proposes this new cost mode named "path-graph".

   However, the "path-graph" will increase the complexity of the Cost
   Map Response.  Since the applications select ALTO as the protocol to
   get the network information rather than other topology-based solution
   such as I2RS, the major reason should be the simplicity.  If we
   provide "path-graph" for each PID pairs, the ALTO client has to
   handle the complex data structure.

   What's more, the "path-vector" is powerful enough to express multiple
   paths.  The simple solution is to list the network elements of all
   accessible paths in a single path vector.  This solution will lose
   the information about paths.  Another solution is to define the path
   as a new type of network elements.  In this way, the path vector can
   provide an array of paths.  Each element of this array contains a
   path vector of network elements in the Network Element Property Map.

   So in this document, we just introduce "path-vector" as the only
   required cost mode for routing state information.

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector            March 2017


9.2.  Provide More General Calendar Extension

   Cost Calendar is proposed as a useful ALTO extension to provide the
   historical cost values for Filtered Cost Map Service and Endpoint
   Cost Service.  Since path vector is an extension to these services,
   it SHOULD be compatible with Cost Calendar extension.

   However, the calendar of a path-vector (Endpoint) Cost Map is
   insufficient for the application which requires the historical data
   of routing state information.  The (Endpoint) Cost Map can only
   provide the changes of the paths.  But more useful information is the
   history of network element properties which are recorded in the
   dependent Network Element Property Map.

   Before the Unified Property Map is introduced as an ALTO extension,
   Filtered Cost Map Service and Endpoint Cost Service are the only
   resources which require the calendar supported.  Because other
   resources don't have to be updated frequently.  But Network Element
   Property Map as a use case of Unified Property Map will collect the
   real-time information of the network.  It SHOULD be updated as soon
   as possible once the metrics of network elements change.

   So the requirement is to provide a general calendar extension which
   not only meets the Filtered Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Service but
   also applies to the Property Map Service.

9.3.  Real-time Routing State

10.  Security Considerations

   We can identify multiple potential security issues.  A main security
   issue is network privacy, as the path-vector information may reveal
   more network internal structures than the more abstract single-node
   abstraction.  The network should consider protection mechanisms to
   reduce information exposure, in particular, in settings where the
   network and the application do not belong to the same trust domain.
   On the other hand, in a setting of the same trust domain, a key
   benefit of the path-vector abstraction is reduced information
   transfer from the network to the application.

   The path-vector query may also reveal more information about the
   application.  In particular, the application may reveal all potential
   transfers sites (e.g., where the data source is replicated, and where
   the potential replication sites are).  The application should
   evaluate the potential privacy concerns.

   Beyond the privacy issues, the computation of the path-vector is
   unlikely to be cachable, in that the results will depend on the

   particular requests (e.g., where the flows are distributed).  Hence,
   this service may become an entry point for denial of service attacks
   on the availability of an ALTO server.  Hence, authenticity and
   authorization of this ALTO service may need to be better protected.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  ALTO Cost Mode Registry

   This document specifies a new cost mode "path-vector".  However, the
   base ALTO protocol does not have a Cost Mode Registry where new cost
   mode can be registered.  This new cost mode will be registered once
   the registry is defined either in a revised version of [RFC7285] or
   in another future extension.

11.2.  ALTO Cost Metric Registry

   A new cost metric needs to be registered in the "ALTO Cost Metric
   Registry", listed in Table 1.

                   +-------------+---------------------+
                   | Identifier  | Intended Semantics  |
                   +-------------+---------------------+

                   +-------------+---------------------+

                        Table 1: ALTO Cost Metrics

11.3.  ALTO Entity Domain Registry

   As proposed in Section 9.2 of [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props], "ALTO
   Entity Domain Registry" is requested.  Besides, a new domain is to be
   registered, listed in Table 2.

   +-------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
   | Identifier  | Entity Address Encoding  |  Hierarchy & Inheritance |
   +-------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
   | ane         |    See Section 6.2.2     |                     None |
   +-------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

                        Table 2: ALTO Entity Domain

11.4.  ALTO Network Element Property Type Registry

   The "ALTO Network Element Property Type Registry" is required by the
   ALTO Entity Domain "ane", listed in Table 3.
