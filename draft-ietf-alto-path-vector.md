--- abstract

This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
(ALTO) protocol. It extends the ALTO Cost Map service and ALTO Property Map
service so that the application can decide which endpoint(s) to connect based on
not only numerical/ordinal cost values but also details of the paths. This is
useful for applications whose performance is impacted by specified components of
a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g., they may infer that several paths share
common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths. This
extension introduces a new abstraction called Abstract Network Element (ANE) to
represent these components and encodes a network path as a vector of ANEs. Thus,
it provides a more complete but still abstract graph representation of the
underlying network(s) for informed traffic optimization among endpoints.

Revision -14

- addresses the comments in the chair review,
- fixes most issues raised by IDNits.

## Changes since -12

Revision -13

- changes the abstract based on the chairs' reviews
- integrates Richard's responds to WGLC reviews

## Changes since -11

Revision -12

- clarifies the definition of ANEs in a similar way as how Network Elements is
  defined in {{RFC2216}}
- restructures several paragraphs that are not clear (Sec 3, Path Vector bullet, Sec 4.2, Sec 5.1.3, Sec 6.2.4, Sec 6.4.2, Sec 9.3)
- uses `ALTO Entity Domain Type Registry`

## Changes since -10

Revision -11

- replaces "part"  with "components" in the abstract;
- identifies additional requirements (AR) derived from the flow scheduling
  example, and introduces how the extension addresses the additional
  requirements
- fixes the inconsistent use of "start" parameter in multipart responses;
- specifies explicitly how to handle "cost-constraints";
- uses the latest IANA registration mechanism defined in
  {{I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new}};
- renames `persistent-entities` to `persistent-entity-id`;
- makes `application/alto-propmap+json` as the media type of defining resources
  for the `ane` domain;
- updates the examples;
- adds the discussion on ephemeral and persistent ANEs.


## Changes since -09

Revision -10

- revises the introduction which
  - extends the scope where the PV extension can be applied beyond the "path
    correlation" information
- brings back the capacity region use case to better illustrate the problem
- revises the overview to explain and defend the concepts and decision choices
- fixes inconsistent terms, typos

## Changes since -08

This revision

- fixes a few spelling errors
- emphasizes that abstract network elements can be generated on demand in both
  introduction and motivating use cases

## Changes Since Version -06 #

- We emphasize the importance of the path vector extension in two aspects:

  1. It expands the problem space that can be solved by ALTO, from preferences
     of network paths to correlations of network paths.
  2. It is motivated by new usage scenarios from both application's and
     network's perspectives.

- More use cases are included, in addition to the original capacity region use
  case.

- We add more discussions to fully explore the design space of the path vector
  extension and justify our design decisions, including the concept of abstract
  network element, cost type (reverted to -05), newer capabilities and the
  multipart message.

- Fix the incremental update process to be compatible with SSE -16 draft, which
  uses client-id instead of resource-id to demultiplex updates.

- Register an additional ANE property (i.e., persistent-entities) to cover all
  use cases mentioned in the draft.
